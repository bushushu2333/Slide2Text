## Preface
This chapter explores the concept of data, its various types, and its pivotal role in driving digital transformation. It emphasizes the importance of data collection, storage, and analysis in enabling informed decision-making and shaping effective business strategies.

## Theoretical Section
Data is the cornerstone of digital transformation, serving as the foundation upon which businesses build their strategies and operations. In the context of digital transformation, data refers to the vast amounts of information generated by various sources, including customer interactions, operational processes, and market trends. This data can be categorized into structured data, which is organized and easily searchable, and unstructured data, which includes more complex formats like text, images, and videos.

The process of digital transformation involves leveraging this data to gain insights, optimize processes, and create new business models. Data collection is the first step, where businesses gather information from multiple sources. This is followed by data storage, where the collected data is securely stored in databases or cloud systems. The final step is data analysis, where advanced tools and techniques are used to extract meaningful insights from the data. These insights enable businesses to make informed decisions, predict future trends, and stay competitive in the market.

## Example Section
One notable example of a Japanese company effectively utilizing data in its digital transformation is **Rakuten**, a leading e-commerce and internet services company. Rakuten has implemented a comprehensive data strategy that involves collecting vast amounts of customer data from its various platforms, including e-commerce, banking, and telecommunications.
